# Sample Coordination Data for d=2 (Qubit)
# Generated from continuous homodyne measurement trajectory
# Measurement strength gamma = 1.0 MHz, chi/kappa = 1.0
# Time unit: microseconds (μs)
# Coordination measures: Phi_d (duration), Phi_f (frequency), Phi_a (agency/coordination capacity)
# S_coord_cumulative: Running integral of Phi_a
#
# This is a TEMPLATE file showing the expected format.
# Replace with actual simulation data.
